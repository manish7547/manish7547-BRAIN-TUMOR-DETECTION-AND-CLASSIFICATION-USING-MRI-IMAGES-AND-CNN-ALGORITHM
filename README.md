# manish7547-BRAIN-TUMOR-DETECTION-AND-CLASSIFICATION-USING-MRI-IMAGES-AND-CNN-ALGORITHM
In this reaserch paper we have concentrate on MRI Images through brain tumor detection using normal  brain image or abnormal by using CNN algorithm deep learning. The brain is largest and most complex  organ in human body that works with billions of cells. Tumors types like benign and malignant tumor.  The MRI images and CNN algorithm is used to detecting the brain tumorThere are many existing 
techniques are available for brain tumor segmentation and classification to detect the brain tumor. 
Number of techniques available to detect the brain tumors. CNN based classifier is used to compare the 
trained data and test data, from this data get the best result.
Keywords - Brain Tumor, CNN, Deep Learning, Segmentation, MRI, Classification.
